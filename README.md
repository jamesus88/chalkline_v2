## About/How the magic works
It all starts with a league...

Your league creates a Chalkline setup and imports any data necessary for the season.
Customizing your league is easy and built-in.
Chalkline supports as many teams and users as you provide.
Scheduling is key.

Import your schedule or have Chalkline create one for you.*
Master schedules are easily accessible and custom views are available for each user.
Teams can view the standings and their upcoming games or practices.
Umpires are the cogs of the machine.

Chalkline Baseball™ allows umpires to schedule themselves, without the need for an assignor.
Leagues can assign games manually, or let umpires choose their own schedule.
Coaches can request field umpires to fill their umpire duty, saving time and money.
Never miss an update.

Leagues can send announcments to everyone, or to individual groups/teams.
Rain delay alerts and field closures can be displayed and users can be alerted in seconds.
Automatic reminders are sent out when umpire shifts are filled or game details are changed.
Always improving.

Updates with new features are pushed out every week.
Literally. Every week.
